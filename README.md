## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Functions in this package calculate normal and recovery stage envelopes
for Lake Okeechobee. Complete documentation for this performance measure
can be found on the
[USACE](https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/p16021coll7/id/14096)
webpage.
